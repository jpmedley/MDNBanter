# How to Contribute

I'm happy to take contributions, but there are a few things you need to know.

## Code reviews

I will review all submissions, but reserve the right to decline a particular
pull request. If you want to do more than fix a bug or correct a typo, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/jpmedley/MDNBanter/issues) describing your
idea.
